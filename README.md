Repository
======================
Repository package allows the means to implement a standard boilerplate repository interface. This covers the standard Eloquent methods in a non-static, non-facade driven way right out of the box. Fear not though Batman! The Repository package does not limit you in any way when it comes to customizing (e.g overriding) the provided interface or adding your own methods.

Quick Installation
------------------
Begin by installing the package through Composer.

```
composer require pierresilva/laravel-repository
```
